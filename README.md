# NASCAR Operations Analytics – Performance Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes NASCAR operational performance data to identify delay drivers and process inefficiencies under real-world constraints such as driver changes and penalties.

Using **SQL** for data extraction and transformation and **Tableau Prep / Tableau** for modeling and visualization, I developed optimization recommendations that reduced operational delays by **18%**.

## Objectives
- Identify operational bottlenecks impacting race performance
- Model the impact of penalties and driver changes on delays
- Recommend data-backed process improvements

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (data querying & transformation)
- Tableau Prep (data cleaning & modeling)
- Tableau (visualization & trend analysis)

## Methodology
1. Queried raw operational datasets using SQL
2. Modeled performance under variable constraints (penalties, driver swaps)
3. Analyzed trends and delay propagation
4. Proposed optimization strategies based on findings

## Key Insights
- Penalty timing had a disproportionate impact on downstream delays
- Driver changes increased variance more than mean delay time
- Certain operational sequences consistently underperformed

## Results
- Implemented optimization recommendations led to an **18% reduction in delays**
- Improved predictability and operational throughput
